    <p>Life is beautifully strung together by small moments. The people I love have shaped me in ways I‚Äôll never fully be able to name. 
      Their presence, their trust, their chaos and clarity has molded me into who I‚Äôve become. I carry that with me always, and to them, I am forever indebted.
      Even in the presence of fear and the daunting possibility of failure, I have come to derive my joy from the journey.
    As corny as this all sounds, that is to say: living is so lovely and I carry this outlook with me wherever I go.<br><br>
    Below are a few pieces of my life that have played an integral part in the shaping of who I am today. This page will tell you nothing of my professional
      development nor workplace skillset. However, if you choose to spend a moment reading through, 
      I believe you'll come away knowing me a little more than you did before. In the spirit of nostalgia and growth! I've included a Norah Jones song that 
    my dad always used to play for me when I was little.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have always had an affinity for arts and crafts. I was a notorious rainbow loom kid and throughout elementary school could often be
    found crafting up a new bracelet during the after school program. There, I learned to crochet from one of the teachers and would carry
    my wonky shaped scarves on planes, car rides, and to family dinner parties which led to my mother lovingly calling me "grandma". 
    I have continued this love for small projects and frequently have watercolor nights with my friends at school. My version of art isn't
    the kind that you find in galleries or sell for thousands of dollars, but it fills the lulls in my work week with something that 
    ties me back to my childlike wonder. </p>

    <h2 class="chapter-heading">My Sport</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>From age 8 to 19, I fenced like my life depended on it. In a way, I felt like it did. I had sunk all of my time into getting recruited, leaving no space
      for extra clubs and alternative extracurriculars. Luckily, that dedication paid off and I found myself recruited to Brown University in my junior year of high school.
      Though my Division I Fencing career was short-lived (I left the team in the midst of my freshman year due to getting my fifth
    concussion), I am so grateful for everything the sport has taught me. Fencing monopolized my time in highschool. As soon as I could drive in junior year,
    I was waking up at 5am every day to go to the gym before school, alternating between participating in a mandatory sport at my high school and leaving 
    for practice at 3pm and typically didn't leave my fencing club until shortly after 8. <br><br>Looking back on it now, it's hard to remember what it was like to
      spend 20+ hrs during the week training and traveling every weekend for tournaments. But my body remembers. When something is hard or demanding, I thank the 
      discipline that fencing instilled in me, the mental fortitude it has granted me to tackle challenges head-on. Even though my doctor (and parents) have insisted
      I no longer fence, it will forever be my sport. I remain indebted to my teammates for the friendship and support they always bestowed upon me. And after
      my departure from the team, getting to coach and cheer them on at Regionals was one of the most exciting experiences of my year. I intend to continue nurturing
      the friendships that the sport has given me throughout the years and am so thankful for how it has shaped me as a person.
